Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the {0} position at {1}. I believe that my background in economics combined with my data analysis and research experience makes me a good fit for the role.

My master's degree in economics taught me how to analytically get the most out of the data provided. It emphasized understanding the context in which the data is being used because it affects the choice of model as well as the performance of that model. I have experience working with oil and gas data, financial data, and economic data. 

As a recent economics graduate, working for {1} would be a great start for my career. I believe I would be a good fit and a valuable candidate that would work tirelessly to improve and deliver.
